Christopher Pitt - "Asynchronous PHP"
=====================================

PHP has emerged from itâ€™s dark past; just in time to learn from the advances in event-based programming languages/
platforms. As a result; there is vast, untapped potential in developing event-based, real-time applications. Utilising 
emerging open-source projects, like ReactPHP and Ratchet, PHP developers can join the party.
