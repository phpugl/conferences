Stephan Hochd√∂rfer - "Improving the quality of your JS application"
###################################################################

In the past software earned a reputation for failure. Can we change this situation? Yes, but it's hard to figure out how
a good quality assurance (QA) stack should look like when you have no clue where to start. Done right a good QA stack 
can help you catch problems of any kind as soon as possible. In addition to that it will give you the confidence that 
your application works as intended when it gets deployed to the production environment. In this session I will show you
how we built our own QA stack out of tools like jscs, jshint, Karma, Mocha and Istanbul to cover everything from code 
style issues and unit tests up to integration tests.
