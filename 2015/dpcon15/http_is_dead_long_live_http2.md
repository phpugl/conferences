Ben Ramsey - "HTTP is DEAD. Long Live HTTP/2!"
==============================================

Request for Comments (RFC) 2616 reigned supreme as the specification for the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for
fifteen years. Now, it's been obsoleted by a handful of new RFCs, and HTTP/2 is on the horizon. In this talk, we'll 
take a look at the new RFCs, discuss the differences and clarifications they make, and take a look ahead at what's new 
in HTTP/2 and what it means for you.

Notes
-----

 * HTTP is not dead, only RFC 2616.
 * HTTP/2 will be a binary protocol
 * Because of HTTP/2 you will not need image sprites, javascript/css concatination and minification. Than it will be 
 better to do small requests.
