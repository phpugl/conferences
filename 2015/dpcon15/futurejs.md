Kuba Walinski - "FutureJS - ES6, ES7 and beyond"
================================================

No, FutureJS is neither a new framework nor a library that you will hear everyone in the office talking about. This 
talk is actually about the future of JavaScript, or rather EcmaScript, as that is its official name.The process of 
standardising EcmaScript 6 (aka Harmony) is finally reaching its final stages. The ES Commitee also uncovered plans 
for the future editions of the language (ES7 and beyond). It's time we started getting to know all new features that 
we will all be using in a few years time. Actually, we can do even better! We can start using the most interesting and 
useful features right now thanks to ES6 compilers like Google's Traceur. They will translate the new ES6 code to its 
ES5 equivalent form, which our current browsers can understand and execute. In this talk you will learn what are the 
most exciting new ES6 features as well as how to start using them right now thanks to Traceur.
